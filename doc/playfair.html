<h2>Key</h2>
<p>A word or phrase or random string of letters (but letters only, no spaces, numbers or punctuation). 
Repeating letters in the key have no effect, so the key "rubber" would be the same as "rube".</p>
<h2>History and Facts</h2>
<p>Although this cipher was invented by Charles Wheatstone in 1854, his friend Lyon Playfair, a scientist and
politician, successfully promoted its use to the British parliment, so it became known as the Playfair cipher.</p>
<p>The Playfair cipher uses pairs of letters during encryption, which means that plaintext letters are 
substituted based on the letters that are adjacent to them. For example, the letter <b>e</b> in the word "he" would be
enciphered differently than the <b>e</b> in "me" because they have different letters right before them (an <b>h</b> in one
case and an <b>m</b> in the other). This makes messages harder to attack using frequency analysis.</p>
<p>The way this cipher works, deciphered text may not match the original plaintext exactly -- it may
have extra <b>x</b>'s throughout the message. These can be ignored pretty easily when reading, though.
The cipher also treats the letters <b>i</b> and <b>j</b> interchangeably, so some <b>j</b>'s may really be <b>i</b>'s.
Finally, this implementation automatically strips spaces and punctuation when enciphering.   
<h2>Level of Security</h2>
<p>It is possible for a skilled cryptanalyst to decipher a Playfair enciphered message using just
pencil and paper. There are also some brute force methods more suited to a computer, which don't
require so much skill or patience.</p>
