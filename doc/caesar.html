<h2>Key</h2>
<p>A number from 1 to 25.</p>
<h2>History and Facts</h2>
<p>Julius Caesar enciphered messages to his generals by shifting
each letter in the message three places farther into the alphabet, so that <b>a</b> would be written as <b>D</b>,
<b>b</b>
as <b>E</b>, <b>c</b> as <b>F</b> and so on.</p>
<p>If the algorithm is generalized to be shifting
letters any number of places, then the key is the number of places to shift. For the English 
alphabet, that means that keys from 1-25 are valid.</p>
<p>If you choose the key value of 13, you get
the ROT13 cipher, which is sometimes used to obfuscate information in internet postings.</p>
<h2>Level of Security</h2>
<p>The Caesar cipher offers no real security for a couple of reasons. First, if 
you know that text is encoded with the Caesar cipher, then there are only 25 
possible keys, so it is pretty easy to check each one until the message appears. 
Second, even if you don't know the algorithm, the ciphertext is vulnerable to 
simple frequency analysis.</p>
<p>Still, the Caesar cipher can be used for &quot;entertainment&quot; encryption, 
generating cryptograms like those found in many newspapers.</p>
