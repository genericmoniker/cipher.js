<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Choose whether to encipher (encode) or decipher (decode) a message.</li>
	<li>Pick a cipher algorithm from the list.</li>
	<li>Enter a key. The key is a secret between the sender and receiver!</li>
	<li>Enter your message, and the transformed output appears while you type.</li>
	<li>You can email your message or send it as a text using the bottom menus.</li>
	<li>Use the "reset" bottom menu to clear your message to keep it from prying eyes.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
	<li>By tradition, the plaintext message is in lower case, while the ciphertext is in upper case.</li>
	<li>You can learn more about the ciphers by tapping the "info" icon.</li>
	<li>Punctuation and spaces for some ciphers are passed straight through. If you want to make your message a little harder to crack, leave them out.</li> 
	<li>You can copy your output message to the clipboard by just tapping on it.</li>
	<li>You can see this page again from the Help menu.</li>
</ul>
