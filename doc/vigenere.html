<h2>Key</h2>
<p>A word or phrase or random string of letters (but letters only, no spaces, numbers or punctuation).</p>
<h2>History and Facts</h2>
<p>The Vigenère cipher has been invented and reinvented several times throughout history,
though ironically, not by Blaise Vigenère, the cryptographer whose name it now bears. 
Giovan Battista Bellaso is generally credited with the cipher's current formulation, 
but even earlier descriptions of similar systems exist.</p>
<p>The Vigenère cipher was once known as "the unbreakable cipher", but some general
methods of breaking it have been discovered. For example, Charles Babbage, the 19th 
century mathematician who came up with the idea of a programmable computer, seems
to have broken the cipher out of spite. A cryptographer in his time reinvented the
Vigenère cipher yet again, and when Babbage pointed out that it wasn't new, the
cryptographer responded essentially by saying, "Oh yeah? Let's see you break it!"
Despite being an illogical challenge -- whether the cipher was new or not 
had little to do with whether it could be broken -- Babbage did successfully
decipher the message given to him.
<h2>Level of Security</h2>
<p>The strength of the Vigenère cipher depends largely on the key. If the key is
a single letter, then the cipher is equivalent to the Caesar cipher. With more
letters, breaking the cipher becomes more difficult. If the key is a word, as opposed
to random letters, that can also aid an attacker who is trying to decipher a message.
If the key is a truly random string of letters, and as long as the message being enciphered,
then the Vigenère cipher is equivalent to the "one time pad" cipher, which has been
mathematically proven to be unbreakable when used correctly.</p>
